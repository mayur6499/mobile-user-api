# Mobile User Behaviour Analysis project
## Project Overview:
This project analyzes mobile user behaviour data to understand how users interact with mobile applications and predicts future usage patterns using machine learning.

## Business Problem:
Mobile companies want to:
* Know how users spend time on apps
* Identify heavy vs light users
* Predict churn or high-usage users
* Improve user experience

## Dataset:
1. [ ] Column	Description
2. [ ] User_ID	Unique user
3. [ ] App_Usage_Time	Time spent on apps
4. [ ] Screen_On_Time	Total screen time
5. [ ] Battery_Drain	Battery usage
6. [ ] Data_Usage	Mobile data used
7. [ ] Age	User age
8. [ ] Gender	User gender
9. [ ] Device_Model	Phone model
10. [ ] Number_of_Apps	Installed apps
11. [ ] User_Type	Heavy / Moderate / Light

## Project Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Machine Learning Model
5. Prediction
6. Business Insights

## Machine Learning Model
1. Algorithm: Logistic Regression / Random Forest
2. Target: User_Type or Usage_Category
3. Features: App usage, screen time, data usage, battery drain

## Key Insights:
1. Heavy users have high screen-on time
2. Battery drain strongly relates to app usage
3. Younger users spend more time on apps

## Technology Used:
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib, Seaborn
